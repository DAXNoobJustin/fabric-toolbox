# DAX Query Tuner

Transform slow DAX queries into lightning-fast optimized code using AI assistance and expert knowledge.

## ‚ö° 3-Step Setup (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Install Requirements**
- [Download Python 3.8+](https://python.org/downloads/) (~5 minutes)
  - ‚úÖ Check "Add Python to PATH" during install
- [Download .NET 8.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (~3 minutes)  
  - ‚úÖ Choose ".NET 8.0 Runtime" (not SDK - DaxExecutor is pre-built!)

**Step 2: Setup Tool**
- Download this repository (green "Code" button ‚Üí "Download ZIP")
- Extract anywhere on your computer
- **Double-click `setup.bat`** (or run `setup.ps1` from PowerShell)
- Setup script will:
  - Install Python dependencies
  - Verify DaxExecutor.exe (pre-built, no compilation needed)
  - Unblock ADOMD.NET DLLs (in `dotnet/` folder for XMLA connectivity)
  - Configure VS Code MCP settings

**Step 3: Connect to Your AI**
- Configure your AI client to point at this MCP server
- VS Code (GitHub Copilot Chat / Claude): use `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Claude Desktop: add the same command/args stanza to `claude_desktop_config.json`

## üéâ Start Optimizing

Ask your AI: **"Help me optimize this DAX query"**

## üîå Configure Your AI Client

Once Python packages are installed you can start the MCP server manually:

```bash
python src/server.py
```

Point your AI client at that command:

- **VS Code**: `.vscode/mcp.json` already includes a `dax-query-tuner` entry.
- **Claude Desktop**: add the same command and args inside `claude_desktop_config.json` under `servers`.
- **Other MCP clients**: provide `python` with argument `src/server.py`.

Restart your client after updating its config so it picks up the server.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Get

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `connect_to_dataset` | **Smart connection tool** - Auto-discovers datasets, searches desktop instances, or connects directly based on what info you provide. Works with Power BI Service workspaces AND local Desktop instances. Call with no parameters to discover desktop instances (no auth). Add `location="service"` to discover workspaces instead. |
| `prepare_query_for_optimization` | Complete baseline setup: inline measures, execute baseline, get metadata & research |
| `execute_dax_query` | Test optimization attempts with automatic baseline comparison |
| `get_session_status` | Track your optimization progress, view session history, and get intelligent next step recommendations |

## üöÄ 2-Stage Optimization Workflow

**Stage 1 - Connection**: Connect to your Power BI dataset  
**Stage 2 - Comprehensive Optimization**: Complete baseline analysis ‚Üí Iterative optimization ‚Üí Performance validation

**What Makes It Powerful:**
- **Research-Driven**: Automatically retrieves targeted optimization articles based on query patterns
- **Evidence-Based**: Deep performance trace analysis with Formula Engine vs Storage Engine breakdown
- **Workflow-Guided**: Systematic 2-stage process ensures comprehensive optimization
- **Iterative**: Multiple optimization rounds achieve compound performance improvements
- **Semantic Validation**: Guarantees optimized queries return identical results to baseline

**Quick Development Setup:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/server.py
```

**What's Included:**
- Pre-built `DaxExecutor.exe` (no compilation needed)
- ADOMD.NET DLLs in `dotnet/` folder (for XMLA connectivity)
- Complete Python MCP server implementation

**Optional: Automated Setup (Windows):**
- `setup.bat` ‚Üí launches the PowerShell helper
- `setup.ps1 -NonInteractive` ‚Üí skip prompts (handy for CI or advanced users)
