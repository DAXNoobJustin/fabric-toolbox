# Semantic Model MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for connecting to Microsoft Fabric and Power BI semantic models. This server provides tools to browse workspaces, list datasets, retrieve model definitions (TMSL), execute DAX queries, and create or modify semantic models against semantic models.

A tool designed for Semantic model authors to chat with your Semantic Model in VS Code Co-pilot using your own LLM!!!

Use your local compute rather than your Premium capacity.

This tool is most suited to be run in VS Code to be used as a *chat with your semantic model* feature using your own choice of LLM Server.

Co-pilot in VS Code has far fewer limitations than some MCP Clients and can also allow you to tweak/improve this code for yourself.

## Features

- **Browse Power BI Workspaces**: List all available workspaces in your tenant
- **Dataset Management**: List and explore datasets within workspaces
- **Model Definition Retrieval**: Get TMSL (Tabular Model Scripting Language) definitions
- **DAX Query Execution**: Run DAX queries against semantic models and get results
- **Model Creation & Editing**: Create new semantic models and update existing models using TMSL
- **Fabric Lakehouse Integration**: List lakehouses, Delta tables, and get SQL connection strings
- **DirectLake Model Support**: Create and manage DirectLake models connected to Fabric lakehouses
- **Workspace Navigation**: Get workspace IDs and navigate between different environments

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to Microsoft Fabric/Power BI Premium workspace
- Valid Microsoft authentication (Azure AD)

### üí° **Tips for Better Prompts**

1. **Be Specific**: Include workspace names and dataset names when you know them
2. **Use Natural Language**: The AI can translate your business questions into DAX queries
3. **Ask for Explanations**: Add "and explain the results" to understand what the data means
4. **Request Visualizations**: Ask "create a summary table" or "format the results nicely"
5. **Build on Previous Queries**: Reference earlier results to dive deeper into insights

### üöÄ **Getting Started Workflow**

1. **Start with Discovery**: `"What workspaces do I have access to?"`
2. **Explore Your Data**: `"Show me the structure of my [dataset name] model"`
3. **Ask Simple Questions**: `"How many rows of data do I have?"`
4. **Progress to Business Questions**: `"What are my top selling products?"`
5. **Dive into Analysis**: `"Show me trends and patterns in my sales data"`

### üìù **Example Full Conversation**

```
You: "What workspaces do I have access to?"
AI: [Lists your workspaces using the MCP server]

You: "Show me the datasets in my 'Sales Analytics' workspace"
AI: [Lists datasets in that workspace]

You: "Get the structure of my 'Sales Model' dataset"
AI: [Retrieves TMDL definition showing tables, measures, relationships]

You: "Create a DirectLake model using the tables from my GeneratedData lakehouse"
AI: [Uses MCP server to list lakehouse tables and creates TMSL definition for DirectLake model]

You: "Now add a calculated measure for profit margin to this model"
AI: [Modifies the TMSL to include new measure and updates the model]

You: "Show me the relationships in this new model"
AI: [Retrieves updated TMSL definition and displays the relationships]

You: "That's interesting - can you show me the trend for the 'Electronics' category over time?"
AI: [Creates and runs a more specific DAX query for Electronics trends]
```

Remember: The AI assistant will use the MCP server tools automatically when you mention data analysis, DAX queries, or semantic model exploration in your prompts!

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This server implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing AI assistants and other tools to:

- **Discover** available semantic models and workspaces
- **Inspect** model structure and metadata
- **Query** data using DAX expressions
- **Create** new semantic models from Fabric lakehouses or other data sources
- **Modify** existing models by updating TMSL definitions
- **Manage** DirectLake models connected to Fabric lakehouses
- **Retrieve** complete model definitions for analysis

## Technical Architecture

- **FastMCP Framework**: Built using the FastMCP Python framework
- **Analysis Services**: Leverages Microsoft Analysis Services .NET libraries
- **XMLA Endpoint**: Connects to Power BI via XMLA endpoints
- **Authentication**: Uses Microsoft Identity Client for secure authentication

## Supported Data Sources

- Power BI Premium workspaces
- Microsoft Fabric semantic models
- Analysis Services tabular models
- Fabric Lakehouses and Delta Tables
- DirectLake storage mode
- Any XMLA-compatible endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure you have valid Azure AD credentials and workspace access
2. **Connection Timeouts**: Check network connectivity and workspace availability
3. **Permission Denied**: Verify you have read permissions on the target workspace and semantic model

### Debug Mode

To run in debug mode for troubleshooting:

```bash
python debug.py
```
