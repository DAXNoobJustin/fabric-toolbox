# Power BI Desktop Detection Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented Power BI Desktop detection capabilities for the Semantic Model MCP Server, enabling seamless integration with local Power BI Desktop instances for development and testing workflows.

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### 1. **Core Detection Module** (`tools/powerbi_desktop_detector.py`)
- **Process Detection**: Automatically finds running Power BI Desktop processes (`PBIDesktop.exe`)
- **Analysis Services Discovery**: Identifies corresponding `msmdsrv.exe` processes with port numbers
- **File Association**: Links processes to their .pbix files
- **Connection String Generation**: Creates ready-to-use connection strings
- **Connection Testing**: Validates connectivity to local instances

### 2. **MCP Server Integration** (`server.py`)
- **New Tools Added**:
  - `detect_local_powerbi_desktop()` - Scan for running instances
  - `test_local_powerbi_connection(port)` - Test connectivity
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated server instructions with Power BI Desktop capabilities
- **Import Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing MCP framework

### 3. **Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
- **Added `psutil>=5.9.0`** for process monitoring and system information

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- **README.md**: Added detailed Power BI Desktop integration section with:
  - Feature explanations and use cases
  - Development workflow examples
  - Testing and validation guidance
  - Debugging and troubleshooting tips
- **MCP Prompts**: Added 6 new prompts for Power BI Desktop operations
- **Instructions**: Enhanced server instructions with local development guidance

### 5. **Testing & Validation**
- **Test Script**: `testing/test_powerbi_desktop_detection.py`
- **Usage Examples**: `examples/powerbi_desktop_usage_examples.py`
- **Verified Working**: Successfully detects real Power BI Desktop instances

## 🔍 Key Features

### **Automatic Discovery**
- Scans for `PBIDesktop.exe` processes
- Identifies Analysis Services (`msmdsrv.exe`) instances
- Discovers dynamic port numbers (typically > 50000)
- Associates processes with .pbix files

### **Connection Management**
- Generates connection strings: `Data Source=localhost:{port}`
- Tests connectivity to local instances
- Provides detailed diagnostic information
- Handles authentication and access validation

### **Development Integration**
- **Local BPA Analysis**: Run Best Practice Analyzer against local models
- **DAX Testing**: Execute queries against local instances
- **TMSL Validation**: Analyze model structure during development
- **Performance Testing**: Validate changes before publishing

## 🚀 Verified Functionality

### **Real-World Testing Results**
```
🖥️ Power BI Desktop Instances:
  Instance 1:
    - Process ID: 263124
    - File Path: C:\Users\phseamar\OneDrive - Microsoft\...\2025-06 - Issue Summary.pbix
    - AS Port: 51542
    - Connection: Data Source=localhost:51542

⚙️ Analysis Services Instances:
  Instance 1:
    - Process ID: 269116
    - Port: 51542
    - Power BI Desktop: True
    - Connection: Data Source=localhost:51542
```

## 🎯 Use Cases Enabled

### **1. Local Development Workflow**
1. Open .pbix file in Power BI Desktop
2. Use MCP server to detect the instance
3. Run BPA analysis during development
4. Test DAX queries before publishing
5. Validate model changes locally

### **2. Testing & Validation**
- Verify model performance with local data
- Test new calculations and measures
- Validate relationships and hierarchies
- Check formatting and display properties

### **3. Debugging & Troubleshooting**
- Analyze models that won't publish
- Debug DAX expression issues
- Investigate performance problems
- Validate TMSL structure before deployment

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Detection Logic**
```python
# Process scanning with psutil
for process in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
    if process_name == 'PBIDesktop.exe':
        # Extract .pbix file path from command line
        # Link to corresponding Analysis Services instance
        
    if process_name == 'msmdsrv.exe':
        # Extract port from cmdline or network connections
        # Determine if it's a Power BI Desktop instance
```

### **Port Discovery**
- Command line argument parsing (`-s localhost:port`)
- Network connection analysis (listening on localhost)
- Dynamic port range detection (>50000 for Power BI Desktop)

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of access denied scenarios
- Robust process enumeration with exception handling
- Safe attribute access for process information

## 📊 Impact

### **Enhanced Development Experience**
- **Reduced Development Time**: Instant access to local models
- **Early Issue Detection**: BPA analysis during development
- **Seamless Testing**: Local validation before publishing
- **Improved Debugging**: Direct access to development models

### **Integration Benefits**
- **Unified Tooling**: Same MCP interface for local and cloud models
- **Consistent Analysis**: BPA rules work identically on local instances
- **Streamlined Workflow**: No need to publish for testing
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Faster iteration cycles

## 🎉 Conclusion

The Power BI Desktop detection implementation successfully extends the Semantic Model MCP Server's capabilities to include local development scenarios. This enables developers to:

- **Work locally** with Power BI Desktop instances
- **Test early** using BPA and other analysis tools
- **Debug efficiently** with direct model access
- **Validate thoroughly** before publishing to the service

The implementation is robust, well-tested, and fully integrated with the existing MCP framework, providing a seamless experience for both local and cloud-based semantic model development.
